FizzBuzz is a simple counting game where people take turns saying numbers. Instead of saying the number out loud. Here are the special rules:

If the number is divisible by 3, you say "Fizz" instead of the number.
If the number is divisible by 5, you say "Buzz" instead of the number.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you say "FizzBuzz."
If none of these conditions apply, you just say the number.

So, instead of saying "3," you'd say "Fizz." Instead of saying "5," you'd say "Buzz." And for a number like 15 (which is divisible by both 3 and 5), you'd say "FizzBuzz."

Folllowing is information/guidlines to adhere to when programming the FizzBuzz game:
(Applicable to fizzbuzz_oop.py)

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
Example 3:

Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104

Please find the solution (Code in Python) in fizz_buzz.py.

There are two ways to run the program:
1. Click the play button top right side of the window.
2. Navigate to the terminal by pressingg Ctrl+~, type "python3 fizzbuzz_oop.py" without
the quote marks and hit enter.
